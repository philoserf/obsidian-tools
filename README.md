## Validate Plugin Manifest

A tool to check an Obsidian plugin manifest against community rules as described in the [Validate Plugin Entry workflow](https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-releases/blob/master/.github/workflows/validate-plugin-entry.yml) of the obsidianmd/obsidian-releases project.

### Installation

```bash
# Build from source
go build -o obsidian-validate-plugin-manifest ./validate-plugin-manifest

# Or use Task (recommended)
task build

# Run from source
go run ./validate-plugin-manifest/main.go
```

### Usage

```bash
# Simple validation with default manifest.json
./obsidian-validate-plugin-manifest

# Validate a specific manifest file
./obsidian-validate-plugin-manifest --manifest path/to/manifest.json

# Output in JSON format (useful for CI/CD)
./obsidian-validate-plugin-manifest --manifest path/to/manifest.json --json

# Suppress informational output
./obsidian-validate-plugin-manifest --manifest path/to/manifest.json --quiet

# Show version information
./obsidian-validate-plugin-manifest --version
```

### Validation Rules

The validator checks that manifest files comply with the Obsidian community plugin guidelines:

- Plugin ID and name must not contain "obsidian" or end with "plugin"
- Description must not contain "obsidian" or phrases like "this plugin"
- Description should be under 250 characters
- Version and minAppVersion follow proper format (numbers and dots only)
- URLs don't point to the Obsidian website
- Email addresses are discouraged in the author field

### Testing

Run the unit tests with:

```bash
# Using Go directly
go test ./validate-plugin-manifest

# Or using Task (recommended)
task test
```

For more detailed test output:

```bash
# Using Go directly
go test -v ./validate-plugin-manifest

# Or using Task
task test -- -v
```
